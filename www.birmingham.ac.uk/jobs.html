<h3>Birmingham</h3>
<p>One of the things our staff say most about working for us in Birmingham is that they love campus life.&nbsp; Often compared to a village, our grounds boast beautiful gardens, sports facilities, shops, and eateries for lunch, networking, and socialising into the evening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://barber.org.uk/">Barber Institute</a>, <a href="https://www.winterbourne.org.uk/">Winterbourne Gardens</a>, and <a href="bramall/index.html">Bramall Music Building</a> are among our campus attractions. We host a wide variety of cultural and sporting events for the city - making us one of the top destinations in Birmingham for academics and tourists alike.</p>
<h3>Dubai&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Dubai is just as impressive - combining cutting edge technology with heritage, tradition, and the beauty of Arabic culture and architecture.</p>
<p>Our second campus is located in Dubai International Academic City (DIAC), the world&rsquo;s largest free zone dedicated solely to education.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Designed with collaboration in mind, this state of the art campus occupies a prominent position at the heart of academic city and boasts an incredible range of facilities for staff and students alike.&nbsp;</p>
